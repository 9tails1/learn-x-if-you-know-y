# Learn X if you Know Y

Where X = Programming language that you want to learn & Y = Programming language that you already know.

Lean X if you know Y is a different way to learn the syntax of a new programming language if you already know other. Just select the language that you want to learn and the language that you already know. Now you can start to learn with comparative examples about coding different stuff in each language.

### I want to learn

Just go to [Learn X if you know Y](https://gersonlazaro.com/learn-x-if-you-know-y/index.html), choose the desired languages, and start to learn. It's a piece of cake.

### I want to contribute

This site needs help to grow. If you know some programming language (it doesn't matter if we already have it in the site or not), and want to help us, go to [contributing.md](contributing.md) and read the instruction for making contributions.
